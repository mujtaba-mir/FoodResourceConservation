        <h3>PROPER FOOD STORAGE</h3>
        <p>
          Proper food storage helps to preserve the quality and nutritional value of the foods you purchase, and also helps make the most of your food dollar by preventing spoilage. Additionally, proper food storage can help prevent foodborne illnesses caused by harmful bacteria.

food storage

Use fresh, perishable foods soon after they are harvested or purchased. Signs of spoilage that make food unpalatable but not a bacterial hazard are the rancid odor and flavor of fats caused by oxidation, slime on the surface of meat, and the fermentation of fruit juices due to yeast growth. Off-odors in foods and a sour taste in bland foods can indicate dangerous bacterial
 spoilage. However, food can be high in bacteria count even without such signals.

        <h3>COMPOSTING</h3>
        <p>
          Composting is nature’s way of recycling. It is one of the most powerful actions we can take to reduce our trash, address climate change, and build healthy soil. By turning our food scraps and yard trim into compost, we can transform our waste streams into a beneficial, value-added soil amendment and use it to protect the environment and create resilient communities.

Composting is a resourceful way to recycle the food scraps and yard trim you generate at home all year and manage your waste more sustainably.
You reduce the volume of materials that might otherwise be disposed in landfills or trash incinerators - leaves, grass clippings, yard trim, and food scraps – and prevent powerful greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere.
Composting involves minimal effort, equipment, expense, and expertise, and can be fun. 
You save money by producing a free, high quality soil amendment – compost, which reduces your use of fertilizer and pesticides.
You can use your compost to build healthier soil, prevent soil erosion, conserve water, and improve plant growth in your garden and yard.

        <h3>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</h3>
        <p>

          Agriculture often places significant pressure on natural resources and the environment. Sustainable agricultural practices are intended to protect the environment, expand the Earth’s natural resource base, and maintain and improve soil fertility. Based on a multi-pronged goal, sustainable agriculture seeks to:
          <br>

         <br> >> Increase profitable farm income
         <br> >> Promote environmental stewardship
         <br> >> Enhance quality of life for farm families and communities
         <br> >> Increase production for human food and fiber needs
<br>
         Sustainable agriculture frequently encompasses a wide range of production practices, including conventional and organic. A regionally integrated system of plant and animal production practices are designed to produce long-term results such as:
<br>
          
          <br> >> Production of sufficient human food, feed, fiber, and fuel to meet the needs of a sharply rising population
          <br> >>  Protection of the environment and expansion of the natural resources supply
          <br> >> Sustainment of the economic viability of agriculture systems

          <h3>EDUCATION AND AWARENESS</h3>
          <p>
            Education and awareness play a crucial role in promoting food conservation, which is essential for reducing food waste and ensuring food security. Food conservation involves various practices that prevent food spoilage and extend the shelf life of perishable foods. By educating people about these practices and raising awareness about the importance of food conservation, we can reduce food waste and help to alleviate food insecurity.
<br>
One of the key aspects of food conservation is understanding the causes of food spoilage. As the study mentioned, microorganisms in soil, air, and water can cause food to spoil, and temperature plays a significant role in this process. By educating people about these factors, we can help them to make informed decisions about storing and preserving their food.
<br>
Another important aspect of food conservation is understanding food preservation techniques. Drying, canning, and freezing are all effective methods of preserving food, and it's essential to educate people about these techniques to help them reduce food waste and save money.
<br>
In conclusion, education and awareness are vital for promoting food conservation. By educating people about the causes of food spoilage and the various preservation techniques available, we can help to reduce food waste and improve food security for all.

          <h3>DONT WASTE FOOD</h3>
          <p>
            Food spoilage can be defined as any sensory change of the food which becomes harmful to consumers and unsuitable to eat. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to discover the degree of awareness and understanding about food spoilage and preservation among Saudi women in Jeddah. Questionnaires were developed and distributed among female students (n=110) in King Abdul-Aziz University. The data were used to conduct frequency analysis. The results demonstrated that 84.6% (1.8 ± 1.0) of respondents agreed that foods spoiled by the action of microorganisms in soil, air, and water. In addition, over 90% of respondents have shown agreement on the effect of temperature on the foods spoilage, food poisoning occurs when consuming foods contaminated with bacteria or viruses and food drying is a method of food preservation. In addition, above 50% of the respondents have knowledge about eggs preservation and the practices when seeing mold on both hard and soft fruits and vegetables. Additionally, respondents have agreed (~50%) that meat should be stored from 3-5 days in the fridge. Respondents of 81.3% have agreed that dry grain stored at cool temperatures can safely increase the shelf-life. Overall, there was a high ratio of awareness among the Saudi women about the food spoilage and preservation.

          <h3>FOLLOW SDG GOALS</h3>
          <p>
            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations provide a roadmap for countries to achieve a sustainable future for all. One of the key goals is to ensure sustainable patterns of consumption and production. This is particularly important when it comes to food conservation.
<br>
Food waste and loss are major issues around the world, with approximately one-third of all food produced globally being lost or wasted. This not only contributes to hunger and malnutrition but also has significant environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of natural resources. By following the SDGs, we can work towards reducing food waste and loss, promoting sustainable agriculture, and ensuring food security for all.
<br>
The SDGs also emphasize the need to protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, which are essential for food production. By adopting sustainable practices in agriculture, we can promote healthy soils, reduce the use of harmful pesticides and fertilizers, and protect water sources. This can lead to increased yields, improved food quality, and reduced environmental impacts.
<br>
Overall, following the SDGs for food conservation is crucial for achieving a sustainable future. By reducing food waste, promoting sustainable agriculture, and protecting ecosystems, we can ensure that future generations have access to healthy and nutritious food while also protecting our planet.
