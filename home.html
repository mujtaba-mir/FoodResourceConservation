    <h4>Food Resources Conservation</h4>

    <b> It is of great importance that one understands where or what their source of food is. <br>
    
    A balanced diet is a necessity if one wants to lead a healthy life. This balanced diet involves different carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, fats and so on. So, how does one ensure that a balanced diet is maintained?<br>

    The first step is to know where do they come from so that we can understand the different nutrients provided by that particular item of food. Let’s have a glimpse of food sources and plant and animal products we consume. <br>

          <p>It is estimated that out of about 2,50,000 species of plants, only about 3,000 have been tried as agricultural crops. Under different agro-climatic condition, 300 are grown for food and only 100 are used on a large scale.
            Some species of crops provide food, whereas others provide commercial products like oils, fibres, etc. Raw crops are sometimes converted into valuable edible products by using different techniques for value addition .At global level, only 20 species of crops are used for food. These, in approximate order of importance are wheat, rice, corn, potatoes; barley, sweet potatoes, cassavas, soybeans, oats, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, sugar beets, rye, peanuts, field beans, chick-peas, pigeon- peas, bananas and coconuts. Many of them are used directly, whereas other can be used by changing them by using different techniques for enhancing calorific value.

          <p>Domesticated animals are an important food source. The major domesticated animals used as food source by human beings are ‘ruminants’ (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, camel, reindeer, llama, etc.).
            Ruminants convert indigestible woody tissue of plants (cellulose) which are earth’s most abundant organic compound into digestible food products for human consumption. Milk, which is provided by milking animals, is considered to be the complete food. Other domestic animals like sheep, goat, poultry and ducker can be used as meat.</p>

        <img src="aquaculture.jpeg" alt="Agriculture" style="width: 100%; height: 200px;" >
          <p> Aquaculture resources comprise a wide variety of animals and plants (and their genetic resources) such as fish; crustaceans, molluscs, seaweeds and other aquatic plants. The most harvested species are oysters and carps. The use of local species is recommended but introduced species are responsible for 17% of the world's finfish production with significant social, environmental, genetic and economic impact. The culture of several important species still relies on the collection of brood stock or seed from natural populations. Aquafeed resources production is one of the fastest expanding agricultural industries in the world, with growth rates in excess of 30 percent per year.</p>

  <p>
    <b> As per estimates of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about 840 million people remain chronically hungry and out of this 800 million are living in the developing world. In last decade, it is decreasing at the rate of 2.5 million per year, but at the same time world’s population is increasing. Target of cutting half the number of world’s chronically hungry and undernourished people by 2015 will difficult to meet, if the present trend continues. Due to inadequate purchasing power to buy food, it is difficult to fulfil minimum calorific requirement of human body per day. Large number of people are in India are poor which can be attribute to equitable distribution of income. Food insufficiency can be divided into two categories into under-nourishment and malnourishment. Both of these insufficiencies are global problems.

          <h3>Under Nourishment</h3>
          <img src="undernourishment.jpeg" alt="Storage" style="width: 100%; height: 200px;" >       
          <p>
            The FAO estimates that the average minimum daily caloric intake over the whole world is about 2,500 calories per day. People who receive less than 90% of their minimum dietary intake on a long-term basis are considered undernourished. Those who receive less than 80% of their minimum daily caloric intake requirements are considered ‘seriously’ undernourished. Children in this category are likely to suffer from stunted growth, mental retardation, and other social and developmental disorders. Therefore, Under-nourishment means lack of sufficient calories in available food, resulting in little or no ability to move or work.

          <p>
            Person may have excess food but still diet suffers from due to nutritional imbalance or inability to absorb or may have problem to utilize essential nutrients. If we compare diet of the developed countries with developing countries people in developed countries have processed food which may be deficient in fibre, vitamins and other components where as in the diet of developing countries, may be lack of specific nutrients because they consume less meat ,fruits and vegetables due to poor purchasing power .
            Malnourishment can be defined as lack of specific components of food such as proteins, vitamins, or essential chemical elements.

          <p> 
            For photosynthesis apart from water, sunshine and CO2, plants need micro and macro nutrients for growth. These nutrients are supplied in the shape of fertilizers. There is lot of potential to increase food productivity by increasing fertilizer use. On one hand application of artificial chemical fertilizers increases the productivity at faster rate as compare to organic fertilizers, on the other hand application of fertilizers can be a serious problem of pollution and can create number of problems. Excessive level of nitrates in ground water has created problems in developed countries.
