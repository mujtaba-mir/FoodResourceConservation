    <center><h4>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</h4>
      <p><!--TEXT GRID-->

        The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals,<br>
         were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, <br>
        protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance <br>
        social, economic and environmental sustainability.
        Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. <br> The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
        
        The creativity, knowhow, technology <br> and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.
        <br><br>

The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half.

        There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50 percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system.
